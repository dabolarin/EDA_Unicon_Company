# # Activity: Structure your data 

# ## Introduction
# 
# In this activity, you will practice structuring, an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** step that helps data science projects move forward. During EDA, when working with data that contains aspects of date and time, "datetime" transformations are integral to better understanding the data. As a data professional, you will encounter datatime transformations quite often as you determine how to format your data to suit the problems you want to solve or the questions you want to answer. This activity gives you an opportunity to apply these skills and prepare you for future EDA, where you will need to determine how best to structure your data.
# 
# In this activity, you are a member of an analytics team that provides insights to an investing firm. To help them decide which companies to invest in next, the firm wants insights into **unicorn companies**â€“companies that are valued at over one billion dollars.  
# 
# You will work with a dataset about unicorn companies, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help you draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, you will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns you find in the dataset. This will develop your skills in EDA and your knowledge of functions that allow you to structure data.
# 
# 
# 
# 

# ## Step 1: Imports 

# ### Import relevant libraries and modules
# 
# Import the relevant Python libraries and modules that you will need to use. In this activity, you will use `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

# In[1]:


# Import the relevant Python libraries and modules needed in this lab.

import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 


# ### Load the dataset into a DataFrame
# 
# The dataset provided is in the form of a csv file named `Unicorn_Companies.csv` and contains a subset of data on unicorn companies. As shown in this cell, the dataset has been automatically loaded in for you. You do not need to download the .csv file, or provide more code, in order to access the dataset and proceed with this lab. Please continue with this activity by completing the following instructions.

# In[2]:


# RUN THIS CELL TO IMPORT YOUR DATA.

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
companies = pd.read_csv("Unicorn_Companies.csv")


# ## Step 2: Data exploration
# 

# ### Display the first 10 rows of the data
# 
# In this section, you will discover what the dataset entails and answer questions to guide your exploration and analysis of the data. This is an important step in EDA. 
# 
# To begin, display the first 10 rows of the data to get an understanding of how the dataset is structured. 

# In[3]:


# Display the first 10 rows of the data.

companies.head(10)


# ### Identify the number of rows and columns
# 
# Identify the number of rows and columns in the dataset. This will help you get a sense of how much data you are working with.

# In[5]:


# Identify the number of rows and columns in the dataset.


companies.shape


# ### Check for duplicates in the data

# In[6]:


# Check for duplicates.

# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'companies'
original_shape = companies.shape

# Drop duplicates from the DataFrame
companies = companies.drop_duplicates()

# Compare the shape before and after dropping duplicates
new_shape = companies.shape

# Print the original and new shape
print("Original Shape:", original_shape)
print("New Shape:", new_shape)


# No dupliactes in the values
# 

# ### Display the data types of the columns 
# 
# Knowing the data types of the columns is helpful because it indicates what types of analysis and aggregation can be done, how a column can be transformed to suit specific tasks, and so on. Display the data types of the columns. 

# In[11]:


# Display the data types of the columns.

companies.dtypes


# ### Sort the data
# 
# In this section, you will continue your exploratory data analysis by structuring the data. This is an important step in EDA, as it allows you to glean valuable and interesting insights about the data afterwards.
# 
# To begin, sort the data so that you can get insights about when the companies were founded. Consider whether it would make sense to sort in ascending or descending order based on what you would like to find.

# In[16]:


# Sort `companies` and display the first 10 rows of the resulting DataFrame.

# Sort the DataFrame by 'year founded' in descending order
companies_sorted = companies.sort_values(by='Year Founded', ascending=False)
companies_sorted.head (10)


# ### Determine the number of companies founded each year
# 
# Find out how many companies in this dataset were founded each year. Make sure to display each unique `Year Founded` that occurs in the dataset, and for each year, a number that represents how many companies were founded then.

# In[17]:


# Display each unique year that occurs in the dataset
# along with the number of companies that were founded in each unique year.

company_counts = companies['Year Founded'].value_counts()

# Print the number of companies founded each year
print(company_counts)


# **2015 has the highest number of companies founded. 

# Plot a histogram of the `Year Founded` feature.

# In[18]:


# Plot a histogram of the Year Founded feature.
plt.hist(companies['Year Founded'], bins=30)
plt.xlabel('Year Founded')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Histogram of Year Founded')
plt.show()


# **Question:** If you want to compare when one company joined unicorn status to when another company joined, how would you transform the `Date Joined` column to gain that insight? To answer this question, notice the data types.
# 

# ### Convert the `Date Joined` column to datetime
# 
# Convert the `Date Joined` column to datetime. This will split each value into year, month, and date components, allowing you to later gain insights about when a company gained unicorn status with respect to each component.

# In[23]:


# Convert the `Date Joined` column to datetime.
# Update the column with the converted values.

## Extract Year Joined form Date Joined.

# Print the DataFrame with the new 'Year Joined' column
companies_new.head(10)


# In[30]:


# Display each unique year which companies joined unicorn status that occurs in the dataset

company_unicorn_count = companies_new['Year Joined'].value_counts()

# Print the number of companies founded each year

# In[31]:


# Obtain the names of the months when companies gained unicorn status.
# Use the result to create a `Month Joined` column.

# Print the DataFrame with the new 'Month Joined' column

# In[33]:


company_unicorn_Month_Count = companies_new['Month Joined'].value_counts()
print(company_unicorn_Month_Count)


# In[39]:


# Plot a histogram of the Year Founded feature.

plt.xlabel('Month Joined')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Histogram of Date Joined')
plt.xticks(months_ordered)
plt.show()


# ### Create a `Years To Join` column
# 
# Determine how many years it took for companies to reach unicorn status, and use the result to create a `Years To Join` column. Adding this to the dataset can help you answer questions you may have about this aspect of the companies.

# In[43]:


# Determine how many years it took for companies to reach unicorn status.
# Use the result to create a `Years To Join` column.



companies_new['Years to Unicorn'] = companies_new['Year Joined'] - companies_new['Year Founded']

# Print the DataFrame with the new 'Years to Unicorn' column

# Use the functions in the `matplotlib.pyplot` module that allow you to set the size, title, x-axis label, and y-axis label of plots. In that module, there is also a function for displaying the plot.

# Use the `plt.bar()` to create the bar plot, passing in the parameters `x`, `y`, and `hue`. For the task at hand, set `hue` to the column that contains year joined. 
# 
# Use `plt.figure()`, passing in the `figsize` parameter to set the size of a plot.
# 
# Use `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()` to set the title, x-axis label, and y-axis label, respectively. 
# 
# Use `plt.show()` to display a plot.
